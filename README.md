Unrekt Crypto Tracker

Project Overview

This project displays the prices and other information of 100 cryptocurrencies. It also allows the user to like a crypto and add it to their favorites list. Once the user likes it the price and quantity of the coin is saved to the local database. The Portfolio.js component displays the user's current holdings, the Coin.js component displays the details of each coin and the Favorites.js component displays the users favorited coins.

We used React to create the project and CoinGecko API to access the crypto data. 

This project was challenging as we recently started learning React but it was also a great learning opportunity as we both are interested in cryptocurrency.
